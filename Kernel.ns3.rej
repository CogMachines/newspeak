 "N.B.: Although Newspeak classes and mixins are represented by the Behavior and Mixin classes of this module, not all code here is live in the system.  In particular, true, false and nil are not instances of the True, False and UndefinedObject defined here but still instances of the corresponding Squeak classes.
 
 This code was derived in part by converting the Strongtalk Magnitude, Boolean and  UndefinedObject classes to Newspeak. For those classes, the Sun Microsystems copyright and BSD license below applies.
